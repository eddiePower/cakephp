<p>Solemate coir doormats are handmade by locals in Kerala, the most Southwestern state in India. This is a vital cottage industry, providing a fair and steady source of income and supporting a sustainable community.</p>
<?php echo $this->Html->image('pages/about-our-mats-1.jpg', array('alt' => 'about-our-mats-image')); ?>
<?php echo $this->Html->image('pages/about-our-mats-2.jpg', array('alt' => 'about-our-mats-image')); ?>
<p>Coir comes from the husk of coconuts. It is a 100% natural and renewable fiber. The pictures above feature coconut husks before and after they’ve been spun.</p>
<?php echo $this->Html->image('pages/about-our-mats-3.jpg', array('alt' => 'about-our-mats-image')); ?>
<p>The coir is then hand-woven into a mat.
  The dyes used for our doormats are fade resistant and eco-friendly.
</p>
<?php echo $this->Html->image('pages/about-our-mats-4.jpg', array('alt' => 'about-our-mats-image')); ?>
<p>Each mat is hand-stenciled and dyed.</p>
<?php echo $this->Html->image('pages/about-our-mats-5.jpg', array('alt' => 'about-our-mats-image')); ?>
<p>After it’s made, each mat is then reviewed for quality. Our Handmade Collection is entirely made by hand, ensuring that your mat is of the highest quality.</p>
