Team Heisenburg Build 2 ------> Order system / Managment backend.

Our second build is all the scafolding and logic needed for the backend of our order processing system, this sub system will have a shopping cart front end on it that will allow users to place and monitor new orders, view and re order from older orders, and generally purchase Ricks goods via an online GUI we design in a later build cycle.


Still to Do List

Everything...

# Team Heisenburg build1 ----> Customer Contact Email subsystem v1.0

We have decided to change build 1 from the proposed connect and display live myob data to the email customer system as we were un able to get a hold of our clients database before the due date so we will be attempting
a user login
a customer display table and both mass email and single client email via checkboxes on each line of the customer display table.
A custom form for building a custom message for the emails and also a file attachment for catalogues or reports.

Working so Far
simple User login / register -->needs to be altered to only allow rick to enable accounts after revieving email notifications.
Customer display table
Mass & single email functionality
Custom form for email building
