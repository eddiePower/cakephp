# Team Heisenburg build1 ----> Customer Contact Email subsystem v1.0

We have decided to change build 1 from the proposed connect and display live myob data to the email customer system as we were un able to get a hold of our clients database before the due date so we will be attempting
a user login
a customer display table and both mass email and single client email via checkboxes on each line of the customer display table.
A custom form for building a custom message for the emails and also a file attachment for catalogues or reports.

Working so Far
simple User login / register -->needs to be altered to only allow rick to enable accounts after revieving email notifications.
Customer display table
Mass & single email functionality
Custom form for email building


Still to do.

Login and ACL (Access control lists) for account types
Fix the database to include more customer details
fix the databse to include a username 
fix login to use username and password for quicker login
fix sign up with a password confirmation
add a forgot my password link and system
Add form validation on email composer.
Add HTML and Text email templates  in the Template folder
Fix email so the message comes from the templates
